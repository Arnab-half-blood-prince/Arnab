# Hi all, I am Arnab.
I am Trottier Chair post-doctoral fellow at [Trotier Space Institute](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/) and [Department of Physics, McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/). I am a data oriented cosmologist and radio astronomer focusing on mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe with radio surveys of the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen. My main research goals are to understand instrumental systematics and foreground challenges and develop tools to mitigate those to extract extremely weak  cosmological 21 cm signal from complex radio data. Currently, I am working on measuring the 21 cm signal in auto-correlation using [CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca), a novel radio interferometer designed for wide-field high-sensitivity surveys. I am also a member of [CHORD](https://www.chord-observatory.ca/), a next-generation radio telescope coming up at Penticton, British Columbia.
